After that, I joined the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I am currently professor and the acacedmic secretary of the institute, and made a total of approximately three-year international academic visits to the USA, Japan, Italy, etc. My research interest includes monsooon, atmospheric and climate dynamics, and climate extremes, focusing on the extra-tropics. My primary areas of expertise are the variability, mechanism, and predictability of the Asian monsoon ranging from the intraseasonal to interdecadal timescales. I heavily apply process-based diagnostics on observational, reanalysis, and model data to identify the critical processes that dominate the monsoon and climate variability. I also seek the potential influences of the stratospheric processes on monsoon variability and predictability. Currently, I am working on the scale interactions, the role of internal climate variability in climate change, and climate extremes. I have published more than 120 articles in refereed scientific journals. I currently serve as an Associate Editor for the Journal of Climate and Frontiers in Earth Science, an editorial board member for Atmosphere, a member of the WCRP Lighthouse Activity Science Plan Development Team, a member of the CLIVAR/GEWEX Asian-Australian Monsoon Working Group, the academic secretary of the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the secretary for the Dynamic Meteorology Commission, Chinese Meteorological Society.
