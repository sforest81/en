I got my Ph.D. in meteorology from the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008. After that, I joined the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I am currently a professor. During this process, I made approximately three years of international academic visits to the USA, Russia, Japan, Italy, and other places.

My research interests include monsoons, atmospheric and climate dynamics, and climate extremes, with a focus on the extratropics. My primary areas of expertise are the variability, mechanisms, and predictability of the Asian monsoon across intraseasonal to interdecadal timescales. I heavily apply process-based diagnostics on observational, reanalysis, and model data to identify the critical processes that dominate the monsoon and climate variability. I also seek the potential influences of stratospheric processes on monsoon variability and predictability. Currently, I am working on scale interactions, the role of internal climate variability in climate change, and climate extremes. 

I have published over 200 articles in refereed scientific journals, such as Science Advances, Nature Communications, Journal of Climate, and Geophysical Research Letters. I serve as the Executive Co-Chief Editor for the Journal of Meteorological Research and Associate Editor for the Journal of Climate and the International Journal of Climatology. I am a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society, the Chair of the Dynamic Meteorology Commission of the Chinese Meteorological Society, a member of the International Commission on Dynamical Meteorology, the Scientific Steering Group of WCRP Lighthouse Activity- My Climate Risk, the Working Group of WCRP Lighthouse Activity- Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change, and the CLIVAR/GEWEX Asian-Australian Monsoon Working Group.
