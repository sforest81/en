Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Professor
Research Interests: Asian monsoon, Climate dynamics, Stratosphere-troposphere interaction, Climate extremes

My research is mainly about mid-latitude climate variability, its mechanism and impacts in boreal winter, focusing on the East Asia-North Pacific region. I am interested in monsoon dynamics, atmospheric teleconnections, climate extreme events, and troposphere-stratosphere dynamical coupling.
