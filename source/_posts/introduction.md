I got my Ph.D. in meteorology from the Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences. After that, I joined the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I am currently professor and the secretary of the institute, and made a total of approximately three-year international academic visits to the USA, Japan, Italy, etc. 

My research interest includes monsooon, atmospheric and climate dynamics, and climate extremes. My primary areas of expertise are the variability, mechanism, and predictability of the Asian monsoon ranging from the intraseasonal to interdecadal timescales. I heavily apply process-based diagnostics on observational, reanalysis, and model data to identify the critical processes that dominate the monsoon and climate variability. I also seek the potential influences of the stratospheric processes on monsoon variability and predictability. Currently, I am working on the scale interactions, the role of internal climate variability in climate change, and climate extremes. 

I have published more than 100 articles in refereed scientific journals. I currently serve as an Associate Editor for the Journal of Climate, an member of the WCRP Lighthouse Activity Science Plan Development Team, and the secretary for the Dynamic Meteorology Commission, Chinese Meteorological Society.
