I got my Ph.D. in meteorology from the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008. After that, I joined the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I am currently a professor, the head of the Center for Monsoon System Research, and the academic secretary of the institute. During this process, I made approximately three years of international academic visits to the USA, Japan, Italy, and other places.

My research interests include monsoons, atmospheric and climate dynamics, and climate extremes, focusing on the extra-tropics. My primary areas of expertise are the variability, mechanism, and predictability of the Asian monsoon, ranging from intraseasonal to interdecadal timescales. I heavily apply process-based diagnostics on observational, reanalysis, and model data to identify the critical processes that dominate the monsoon and climate variability. I also seek the potential influences of the stratospheric processes on monsoon variability and predictability. Currently, I am working on scale interactions, the role of internal climate variability in climate change, and climate extremes. 

I have published over 180 articles in refereed scientific journals, such as Science Advances, Nature Communications, Journal of Climate, and Geophysical Research Letters. I serve as the Executive Co-Chief Editors for the Journal of Meteorological Research and Associate Editor for the Journal of Climate and the International Journal of Climatology. I am the Chair of the Dynamic Meteorology Commission of the Chinese Meteorological Society, a member of the International Commission on Dynamical Meteorology, the Scientific Steering Group of WCRP Lighthouse Activity-My Climate Risk, the Working Group of WCRP Lighthouse Activity-Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change, and the CLIVAR/GEWEX Asian-Australian Monsoon Working Group.
