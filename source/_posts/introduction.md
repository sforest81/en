My research is mainly about mid-latitude climate variability, its mechanism and impacts in boreal winter, focusing on the East Asia-North Pacific region. I am interested in monsoon dynamics, atmospheric teleconnections, climate extreme events, and troposphere-stratosphere dynamical coupling.

**Research Interests**: Asian monsoon, Climate dynamics, Stratosphere-troposphere interaction, Climate extremes
