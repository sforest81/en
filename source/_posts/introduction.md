I got my Ph.D. in meteorology from the Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008. After that, I joined the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I am currently a professor, the head of Center for Monsoon System Research, and the academic secretary of the institute. During this process, I made approximately three years of international academic visits to the USA, Japan, Italy, and other places.

My research interests include monsoons, atmospheric and climate dynamics, and climate extremes, focusing on the extra-tropics. My primary areas of expertise are the variability, mechanism, and predictability of the Asian monsoon, ranging from intraseasonal to interdecadal timescales. I heavily apply process-based diagnostics on observational, reanalysis, and model data to identify the critical processes that dominate the monsoon and climate variability. I also seek the potential influences of the stratospheric processes on monsoon variability and predictability. Currently, I am working on scale interactions, the role of internal climate variability in climate change, and climate extremes. 

I have published more than 180 articles in refereed scientific journals. I serve as an Associate Editor for Journal of Climate, International Journal of Climatology, and Frontiers in Earth Science, and an editorial board member for Atmosphere. I am the Chair of the Dynamic Meteorology Commission of the Chinese Meteorological Society, a member of the International Commission on Dynamical Meteorology, the Scientific Steering Group of WCRP Lighthouse Activity-My Climate Risk, the Working Group of WCRP Lighthouse Activity-Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change, and the CLIVAR/GEWEX Asian-Australian Monsoon Working Group.
