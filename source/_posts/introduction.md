I got my Ph.D. in meteorology from the Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008. After that, I joined the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I am currently a professor and the academic secretary of the institute, and made a total of approximately three-year international academic visits to the USA, Japan, Italy, etc. 

My research interest includes monsoons, atmospheric and climate dynamics, and climate extremes, focusing on the extra-tropics. My primary areas of expertise are the variability, mechanism, and predictability of the Asian monsoon ranging from intraseasonal to interdecadal timescales. I heavily apply process-based diagnostics on observational, reanalysis, and model data to identify the critical processes that dominate the monsoon and climate variability. I also seek the potential influences of the stratospheric processes on monsoon variability and predictability. Currently, I am working on scale interactions, the role of internal climate variability in climate change, and climate extremes. 

I have published more than 140 articles in refereed scientific journals. I serve as an Associate Editor for Journal of Climate, International Journal of Climatology, and Frontiers in Earth Science, and an editorial board member for Atmosphere. I am a member of the International Commission on Dynamical Meteorology, the Scientific Steering Group of WCRP Lighthouse Activity-My Climate Risk, the Working Group of WCRP Lighthouse Activity-Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change, and the CLIVAR/GEWEX Asian-Australian Monsoon Working Group. I am also the academic secretary of the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the secretary for the Dynamic Meteorology Commission, Chinese Meteorological Society.
