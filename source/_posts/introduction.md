Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences， Professor
Research Interests:[Asian monsoon](http://www.escience.cn/system/discover?type=interest&keyword=Asian%2Bmonsoon), [Climate dynamics](http://www.escience.cn/system/discover?type=interest&keyword=Climate%2Bdynamics), [climate extremes](http://www.escience.cn/system/discover?type=interest&keyword=climate%2Bextremes)

My research is mainly about mid-latitude climate variability, its mechanism and impacts in boreal winter, focusing on the East Asia-North Pacific region. I am interested in monsoon dynamics, atmospheric teleconnections, climate extreme events, and troposphere-stratosphere dynamical coupling.
